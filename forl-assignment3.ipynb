    "# Exercise 1. Understanding offline and online imitation learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will focus on imitation learning (IL) and get more insights for behavioral cloning (BC), data aggregation with DAgger, and policy aggregation via SMile. You will play with a classical robotic control task in [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), i.e., the [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/) environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem focuses on a regime with a low data rate (small training set) so that it is straightforward to compare the efficiency of offline and online IL approaches. Efficiency here refers to i) the number of demonstrations needed from the expert; and ii) the number of updates to learn the policy. This assignment can run perfectly on a laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomness and reproducibility.**\n",
    "We employ pseudo-randomness to ensure randomness and reproducibility at the same time, as was done in most of deep learning tasks. To this end, there are two lines of code that you will see a few times.\n",

    "- `seed_everything(seed)`\n",
    "- `env.reset(seed=seed)`\n",

    "The first line resets the seed for packages such as `torch`, and `numpy`. This will be used to ensure that the neural network parameters are initialized the same (if necessary). The second is used to cope with the randomness for `CartPole` environment. More details will be provided on the latter.\n"

    "The first step is to get familiar with packages. We will work with libraries `torch`, `gym`, and `stable_baselines3`. Most people should be familiar with `torch` already, hence we put more emphasis on the other two packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`gym`](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/index.html) and [`gymnasium`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) provide APIs for simulating a control problem (e.g., CartPole), a game (e.g., Atari), and other environments for RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`stable_baselines3`](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) implements various RL algorithms. These algorithms can be easily applied on environments from `gym`. \n",

    "Typically, you can use `pip` or `conda` to install these packages. Just in case that there are problems with package versions, we have tested our code in the environment below `python 3.9.7`, `torch 2.2.2`, `gym 0.26.2`, `gymnasium 0.29.1`. It is recommended to install packages yourself, but if it does not work, you can run the command below for installing needed packages. \n",

In particular, a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart. The goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible.\n",
